        inabilityToComply: "If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.",
        termination: "TERMINATION OF RIGHTS:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\r\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\r\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\r\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\r\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\r\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\r\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\r\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\r\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\r\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\r\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\r\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\r\nYour receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\n2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\r\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\r\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\r\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\r\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under this\r\nLicense shall terminate.\r\n\r\n3. In the event of termination under the above conditions, all end user\r\nlicense agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have\r\nbeen validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior\r\nto termination shall survive termination."
